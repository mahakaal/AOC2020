This repository will contains all the solution I made to solve Advent of Code 2020 daily Questions.

## What is Advent of Code?

As they mention on the [official site](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about):

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small *programming puzzles* for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in __any programming language__ you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other. You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

## Format

Since each day has different problem you'll find different dirs with day + Number of Day; Inside you'll find the input.txt and program to __SOLVE__ the input.
Inside the program, you'll find the question with the 2 *correct* answers (Each participant has different inputs so it depends on what you get).

## Weapon of choice

Language: Python 3.8

IDE/Editor: PyCharm/Vscode

O.S.: Mac OS
